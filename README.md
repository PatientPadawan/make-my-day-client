# Make My Day Events Blog Client

This project was created for Make My Day Events LLC with the idea of allowing administrators to update the site with custom 

blog content. This is achieved through a WYSIWYG editor that outputs an HTML string which is in turn converted to React 

elements. The site features OAuth 2.0 security courtesy of the Okta library and service. The primary purpose of the site is 

providing access to the company via a contact form, which is emailed to an administrator, allowing customers to interact with the 

company. Future plans for the project include adding a Paypal and calendar integration to allow clients to reserve a booking.
